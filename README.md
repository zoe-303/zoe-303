- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zoe-303
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things open source and have a big love for automation, cloud and infrastructure as code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning K8's (AKS) and improving my ansible.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a musician and artist, and work writing infra as code as a technical specialist/team lead in a blue chip company. These repos are my personal repos. They will most likely reflect the chaos, experimentation and playfullness that comes with being a creative and not the professional order that I have to maintain at work.
